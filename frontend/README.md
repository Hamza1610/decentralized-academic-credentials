# Frontend: Decentralized Academic Credentials

## Overview
The frontend of the Decentralized Academic Credentials platform is a React application that provides user interfaces for educational institutions, students, and verifiers. It interacts with the backend canister to issue, view, and verify academic credentials, leveraging Internet Identity for secure authentication.

### Features
- **Institution Interface**: Allows authorized institutions to issue credentials to students.
- **Student Interface**: Enables students to view and manage their credentials.
- **Verification Interface**: Allows third parties to verify the authenticity of credentials.
- **Authentication**: Uses Internet Identity for secure, decentralized login.

### Setup and Installation
1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Canister ID**:
   - Update the canister ID in `src/config.js` to point to your deployed canister.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Component Structure
- **App.js**: Main component handling routing and authentication.
- **InstitutionDashboard.js**: Interface for institutions to issue credentials.
- **StudentDashboard.js**: Interface for students to view their credentials.
- **Verifier.js**: Interface for verifying credentials.
- **Auth.js**: Handles Internet Identity authentication.

### API Integration
The frontend interacts with the backend canister using the Candid interface generated by Azle. Key interactions include:
- **Issuing Credentials**: Calls the `issueCredential` method on the canister.
- **Viewing Credentials**: Queries the `getCredential` method to retrieve credential details.
- **Verifying Credentials**: Uses the `get_credential` method to retrieve and verify the JWT.

### Authentication
- **Internet Identity**: Users authenticate via Internet Identity, providing a secure, decentralized login mechanism.
- **Principal**: The user's principal is used to identify their role and permissions within the application.

### Practical Usage
1. **Login**: Users log in using Internet Identity.
2. **Institution Users**: Navigate to the institution dashboard to issue credentials by providing student principal, degree, and issue date.
3. **Student Users**: View their credentials on the student dashboard.
4. **Verifiers**: Enter a credential ID to verify its authenticity.

### Troubleshooting
- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure Internet Identity is correctly configured and the user has a registered identity.
- **Canister Interaction Errors**: Verify the canister ID and ensure the backend is deployed and running.
